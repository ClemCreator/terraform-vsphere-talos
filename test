                                            In this case this `region` field value is ignored.

                                                  Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                                  differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                                  When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                                  listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                                  select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                                  networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                                  as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                                  and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                                  must match both specified values.

                                                  When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                                                  Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,

                                                  Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                                  Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                                  document how/if Port is interpreted.

                                                  For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                                  long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                                  listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                                  namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                                  from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                                  attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                                  the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                                  SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                                                  following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                                                  * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                                  are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                                  both specified values.
                                                  * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                                  are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                                  both specified values.

                                                  Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                                  If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                                  interpreted.

                                                  When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                                  For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                                  least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                                  listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                                  namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                                  the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                                  attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                                  Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                                          Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                                          If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                                          Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                                                          Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                                          Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                                                          it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                                          negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                                          If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                        A CertificateRequest is used to request a signed certificate from one of the
                        configured issuers.

                        All fields within the CertificateRequest's `spec` are immutable after creation.
                        A CertificateRequest will either succeed or fail, as denoted by its `Ready` status
                        condition and its `status.failureTime` field.

                        A CertificateRequest is a one-shot resource, meaning it represents a single
                        point in time request for a certificate and cannot be re-used.

                                        `LegacyDES`: Less secure algorithm. Use this option for maximal compatibility.

                                `otherNames` is an escape hatch for SAN that allows any type. We currently restrict the support to string like otherNames, cf RFC 5280 p 37
                                Any UTF8 String valued otherName can be passed with by setting the keys oid: x.x.x.x and UTF8Value: somevalue for `otherName`.
                                Most commonly this would be UPN set with oid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3
                                You should ensure that any OID passed is valid for the UTF8String type as we do not explicitly validate this.

                                                  When solving an HTTP-01 challenge, cert-manager creates an HTTPRoute.
                                                  cert-manager needs to know which parentRefs should be used when creating
                                                  the HTTPRoute. Usually, the parentRef references a Gateway. See:

                                                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                                                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                                                    with "Core" support:

                                                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                                                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                                                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                                                    resources.

                                                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                                                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                                                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                                                        Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                                                        to the local namespace of the Route.

                                                        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                                                        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                                                        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                                                        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                                                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                                                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                                        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                                        any namespace to the Service.

                                                        "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                                        connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                                        the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                                        ParentRef of the Route.

                                                        Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                                        differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                                        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                                        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                                        must match both specified values.

                                                        When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                                                        Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,

                                                        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

                                                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                                        SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                                                        following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                                                        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                                        both specified values.
                                                        * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                                        both specified values.

                                                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                                        interpreted.

                                                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
