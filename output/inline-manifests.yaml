                                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                      routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                      any namespace to the Service.

                                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                      "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                      connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                      the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                      ParentRef of the Route.

                                      Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                      differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                      When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                      listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                      select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                      networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                      as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                      and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                      must match both specified values.

                                      Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

                                      long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                      from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                      the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                      SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the

                                      * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                          fetched from the ACME server.
                          If an Authorization is already 'valid', the Order controller will not
                          create a Challenge resource for the authorization. This will occur when
                          working with an ACME server that enables 'authz reuse' (such as Let's
                          Encrypt's production endpoint).
                          If not set and 'identifier' is set, the state is assumed to be pending
                          and a Challenge will be created.

                          the DNS name.
                          For example, if '*.example.com' is the DNS name being validated, this
                          field will be 'true' and the 'identifier' field will be 'example.com'.

            A CertificateRequest is used to request a signed certificate from one of the
            configured issuers.

            All fields within the CertificateRequest's `spec` are immutable after creation.
            A CertificateRequest will either succeed or fail, as denoted by its `Ready` status
            condition and its `status.failureTime` field.

            A CertificateRequest is a one-shot resource, meaning it represents a single
            point in time request for a certificate and cannot be re-used.

                                      In this case this `region` field value is ignored.

                                            There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                                            to the local namespace of the Route.

                                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                            routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                            any namespace to the Service.

                                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                            ParentRef of the Route.

                                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                            must match both specified values.

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                            both specified values.
                                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                            interpreted.

                                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                                            MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will

                                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                        URLs of OCSP responders. The OCSP responders can be queried for the
                        revocation status of an issued certificate. If not set, the
                        certificate will be issued with no OCSP servers set. For example, an
                        OCSP server URL could be "http://ocsp.int-x3.letsencrypt.org".

                                      In this case this `region` field value is ignored.

                                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                            routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                            any namespace to the Service.

                                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                            ParentRef of the Route.

                                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                            must match both specified values.

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the

                                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                            interpreted.

                                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
